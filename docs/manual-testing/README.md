# Manual Testing Hub

This section is the starting point for manual release validation in Nexen.

## Start Here

1. Read the ranked checklist in [Manual Step Priority Ranking](manual-step-priority-ranking.md).
2. Execute all release-blocking steps first.
3. Run the platform workflows below.
4. Record pass and fail evidence in the active session log.
